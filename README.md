# pokedex

## Introduction

This is a personal project based on the world famous console game "Pokemon".

"Pokedex" is an android mobile application written in Java, that allows you to view all the current existing pokemons in the series.

It does so by grabbing the information from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and allows the user to browse basic information of each pokemon.

This personal project demonstrates the usage of the build system Gradle, as well as the ability to design an application based on the Model-View-Controller framework.
